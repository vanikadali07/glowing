🌟 Task 5 Completed – ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd Internship 🌟

For Task 5, I designed a Glowing Beauty Website 💖 — a visually appealing and engaging frontend that brings elegance and emotion to the online beauty shopping experience.

💭 My vision was:

❓ “Can design alone express the luxury of beauty products?”

✨ “How do subtle glows and clean layout impact user engagement?”

✨ Key Features of the App:

💅 A static yet beautifully structured eCommerce-style website

🌟 Glowing UI Design – Soft highlights, vibrant buttons, hover effects, and modern cards

🎨 Fully themed around beauty and elegance with carefully chosen colors and font styles

🖱️ Smooth navigation with button transitions and responsive hover feedback

📱 Responsive Design – Mobile-friendly and optimized for all devices

🧠 Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — No frameworks!
